# ZundaWaters
Casual Sub Sim for WebGL/PC

# Introduction

There are 2 modern sub sims I know:

- **Dangerous Waters**:  
Most Realistic Modern Sub Sim Ever though, Too complicated to launch in Win10/11 and too complicated to start multiplayer. Can't see same sonar screen with friend. Can't speed up game time in multiplayer...DO YOU WANT US TO PLAY 10 HOURS FOR A SINGLE MISSION!????

- **Cold Waters**:  
No Multiplayer

What a modern sub sim dark age! I'll make my own!

# Goal
## Long Term (Just a Dream)

Create an Open Source Study Level Sub Sim that can be developed in a long term future.
- Unreal Engine or Own Made Game Engine with C++/DirectX
- Dynamic Campaign
- User Editable Database and Theater (like that of FalconBMS)

## Mid Term (Maybe?)

Create an Open Source Casual Level Sub Sim to release on Steam (for free)
- English + Japanese
- Unity (Latest)
- Small size theater
- Simple campaign (like that of Cold Waters)
- User Editable Database and Theater (like that of FalconBMS)

## Short Term (Let's keep it practical first)

Create an Open Source Casual Level Sub Sim to release at https://www.freem.ne.jp/ or https://unityroom.com/
- Mainly for Japanese language
- Unity (Latest)
- Small size Combat Area
- Random Scenarios
- Decent Tutorial
- Multiplayer Host Control Game Speed Up
- PvP and PvE(control same ship with clients, you can see the same sonar screen)
- Zundamon Voice
