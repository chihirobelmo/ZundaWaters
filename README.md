# ZundaWaters
Casual Sub Sim for WebGL/PC

# Introduction

There are 2 modern sub sims I know:

- **Dangerous Waters**:  
Most Realistic Modern Sub Sim Ever though, Too complicated to launch in Win10/11 and too complicated to start multiplayer. Can't see same sonar screen with friend. Can't speed up game time in multiplayer...DO YOU WANT US TO PLAY 10 HOURS FOR A SINGLE MISSION!????

- **Cold Waters**:  
No Multiplayer

What a modern sub sim dark age! I'll make my own!
