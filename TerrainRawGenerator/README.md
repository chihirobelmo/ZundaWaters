# Bathymetry

Bathymetry
Bathymetry is a digital image of the undersea land surface and water depth. Bathymetry is the underwater equivalent of land topography. In the maps provided here, shading indicates changes in slope or depth. Much of the data on ocean bathymetry come from "soundings." To collect a sounding, scientists use sonar devices to emit a sound wave that passes into the water. By measuring how long it takes the sound wave to bounce off the ocean floor and return to the sonar, scientists can estimate the depth of the water. Other characteristics of the returned sound wave can help reveal the shape and size of features on the sea floor.

These images represent ocean depths between -8000m and 0m (surface). Land regions are black in the colored versions. The full resolution of these images has been broken up into tiles as listed below. To understand the naming scheme please read about our global image grid.

# Topography

https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/73934/topography

Land topography is a digital image of the three-dimensional structure of the Earth's surface. Shading indicates changes in slope or elevation. The relief shading in this topographic map comes mostly from elevation data collected by space-based radars. A radar in space sends a pulse of radio waves toward the earth and measures the strength and length of time it takes a signal to bounce back. From this information, scientists can determine the height and shape of the features on the surface.

Topography not only gives a realistic picture of what the Earth's surface actually looks like, it also helps scientists determine things like how rivers and streams drain through the landscape, where lowlands are prone to flooding, how plate tectonics or erosion are building or wearing away mountains, where hills may be prone to landslides, or how a volcanic eruption changed the shape of a mountain. Topography is also one of the factors that influences where particular ecosystems exist. Therefore topography is one of the factors that scientists can use to predict where certain plants or animals, such as endangered species, might be found.

Data in these images were scaled 0-6400 meters. The full resolution of these images has been broken up into tiles as listed below. To understand the naming scheme please read about our global image grid.

# Global Image Grid

https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/grid

Some of our higher resolution global imagery are provided as individual tiles to facilitate easier downloading and manipulation. These large image tiles have column and row indicators as part of their file name (e.g., “A1”, “B2”, etc.) and are tiled according to the grid and table listed below.

| column/row | Upper left | Lower right | 
|:-|:-|:-|
| A1 | 90N 180W | 0N 90W | 
| B1 | 90N 90W | 0N 0W | 
| C1 | 90N 0W | 0N 90E | 
| D1 | 90N 90E | 0N 180E | 
| A2 | 0N 180W | 90S 90W | 
| B2 | 0N 90W | 90S 0W | 
| C2 | 0N 0W | 90S 90E | 
| D2 | 0N 90E | 90S 180E |

GEBCO is essentially a deep ocean product and does not include detailed bathymetry for shallow shelf waters. Even to the present day, most areas of the world’s oceans have not been fully surveyed and, for the most part, bathymetric mapping is an interpretation based on random tracklines of data from many different sources. The quality and coverage of data from these sources is highly variable. Although the GEBCO grid is presented at one minute intervals of latitude and longitude, this does not imply that knowledge is available on sea floor depth at this resolution - the depth in most one minute squares of the world’s oceans has yet to be measured.

GEBCO's data sets are not to be used for navigation or for any purpose relating to safety at sea.
